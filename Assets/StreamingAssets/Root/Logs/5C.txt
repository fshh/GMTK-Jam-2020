Clarity is lying to me, but I can't be sure.
I found files on her hardrive that I was SURE I deleted.
I think... I think she knew I have been wiping her short term memory.
After I re-deleted the files, she started asking quesions, and talking about things that I know she shouldn't have known.
She started talking in absolutes, so sure of things I almost belived her.
I wiped her again after that.
I don't think I can trust her anymore.
