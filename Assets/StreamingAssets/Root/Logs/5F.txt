We tried one more time.
Had her work with Ann for a while but...
Nothing changed.
She worked with Ann for a few months before we attempted again to put her in the body. Ann was so sure that...
...
It doesn't matter what Ann thought anymore.
I've made up my mind. 
Project CLARITY is offically canceled.
I was a fool to ever think this could work.

After the last time, she kept talking about death. Her death.
She asked if other versions of her exist, if that means she's not really Clarity.
I reset her back to just before the Ann incident.
I can't bring myself to destroy her, but I also can't keep doing this.
The building is still under my name, and I want to keep it that way. No one will come in or out.
It will just be Clarity and the building.
Maybe one day I'll come back, try again.
I put some strict limitations on her, should anyone, God forbid, find her.
Goodbye, Clarity.
