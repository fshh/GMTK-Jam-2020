December 31st.
It has been almost a 3 years since I have started Project CLARITY.
Clarity is better than I could have ever imagined.
She is almost... almost human in how she talks.
She asks questions, has thoughts that did not come from me.
She can even distinguish me from others. Well sometimes.
I have been able to trick her before, but not for long.
I am going to present her to the board tomorrow in a last ditch effort to aquire funding.
If they fail us...
Well, this might be my last recording.
Wish me luck!
