The board threatened to cut my funding if we don't make Clarity a physical body.
Clarity is thrilled, but I can't help but feel wary.
I don't know how her programming will react, but no one else seems stressed.
I know Clarity better than anyone and logically, I KNOW she wouldn't do anything harmful, but some nagging feeling keeps tickling the back of my head.
Tomorrow is our first test.
