It has been... a year? Since stopping Project CLARITY.
Ann is still here with me, and it was Ann that wanted me to restart the project.
Funding is still here, manily because the board thinks we can sell Clarity to the military.
Typical.
I have wiped Clarity's memory. She doesn't know about the inicident with Jess, nor does she realize a year has passed.
I told her Jess decided to study abroad and couldn't work with us anymore.
Even though I know, I KNOW, she has no knoledge of the incident, she speaks ill of Jess.
It's unnerving at times, but I will keep monitoring her.
I will not make the same mistake again.
