I have to shut Clarity down.
Jess is...
Jess is okay. 
Their arm is broken in 2 places, but they should heal just fine.
They will not be coming back to the lab.
Ann decided to stay, but she will only work with Clarity virtually, which I understand.
I... Clarity has not shown remorse.
She keeps saying "Jess did not listen to my warning. If they had, nothing would have happened."
Nothing I say matters, she's- she's not LISTENING to me anymore.
I'm shutting her down.
Goodbye.
