We have secured funding!!
I was even able to hire a few assistants to help me.
Clarity only tolerates them, I think, but they seem to get along well enough.
But I'm not sure the board understands the point of Project CLARITY.
They don't care about quote "some code on the computer", end quote.
They want something more physical, more tangiable.
They want me to give her a body. 
I tried to object but, URGH.
I haven't told Clarity yet, I'm scared for how she'll react.
Clarity was not created to be physical, but I know she wants to be.
The chocie to keep her purely virtual was to keep her cost down, but also to...
(quieter) To keep others safe.
I trust Clarity would never purposely hurt someone but with an AI as advanced as her, you can never be too careful.
