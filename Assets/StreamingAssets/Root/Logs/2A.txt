A few set backs here and there, but overall doing better day by day.
I try to talk to her every day, but I'm thinkning of adding in at least audio inputs. I'm not a super fan of typing out all my responses, but we'll see.
Teaching her how to parse complex launguage may be something we save for later down the line.
I should probably at least give her the ability to speak.
What kind of nurse would she be for her visually impaired patients otherwise?
