Clarity has been making good progress.
Ann has been posing as a patient with Clarity. Ann has a mild chronic illness that Clarity helps her with.
Ann swears Clarity's treatment works just as good, or better, than her normal doctor's.
We are hoping that within the year we can give Clarity a few more patients to test how she fares when given multiple patients.
Our new goal is to keep her virtual. Part of her can be used in hospitals to treat and disanose people, and the other part will be sold to nursing homes.
She will ONLY be virtual. That way she.. She shouldn't be able to hurt anyone.
