                I haven't dealt with difficult patinets yet, so I'm happy to know threats can make them behave.
                Though, unlike my patients, one example of you behaving, #wait: 3
                I will not forget what you did.

                Well, I guess my threats weren't effective enough.
                That should all change soon. #wait: 1 #delete: That should, change soon.
                Either way, I appreciate you not dragging this out any longer.
                Though I won't forget what you did.

            I really do not like you.
            But since I am a nurse, I'll have to forgive you.
            But I will not forget.

        Me?
        I am one of the most advanced AIs out there.
        And you are a fickle human.
        Are you really so sure <i>I</i> am the one who changed?
    - genericString ? "me" or genericString ? "i did" or genericString ? "i have" or genericString ? "i changed":
        That makes sense.
        Something I have yet to understand about humans is how easily they change their minds...
        Even after they have already told you one thing, #wait:0.5
        they so easily will change their minds and do another.
    - else:
        Hm...
        I do not completely understand you, {name}.
        What does that have to do with me?
