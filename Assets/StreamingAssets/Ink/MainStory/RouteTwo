        I think it might be better to start with the memory game, but the choice is yours.

I will ask you a series of questions.
Please answer honestly.
At the end I will compare your data to previous tests we had done.
<br>
Situation One:
You go to the ice cream shop to get a sundae.
You ask for no whipped cream, but extra cherries.
Once you get your ice cream, you find they did not give listen to your request.
<br>
Do you
A) Eat it anyway
B) Ask for them to remake it
C) Yell at the employee and refuse to pay

*[^A)] 
~ situation1 += "0"
It only takes a moment for them to remake it.
And you're paying, why shouldn't it be what you want?
*[^B)] 
~ situation1 += "1"
It <i>is<i/i> your ice cream. 
They should make it the way you want it.
*[^C)] 
~ situation1 += "2"
...
Maybe a bit far but...
Thank you for your honesty.

-<br> 
Situation Two: 
You ask your roommate to help you find something.
They agree, but you feel thy are barely trying.
Do you feel


A) Sad and upset about your friend's actions #wait: 1
B) Understanding, but still disappointed #wait: 1
C) Angry that your friend is doing this to you #wait: 1

*[^A)]
~ situation2 = "0"
    They are probably not a great friend.
    Why say you will do something and then purposely not do it?
*[^B)]
~ situation2 = "1"
    They should not agree if they were not going to help.
*[^C)]
~ situation2 = "2"
    I would too.
    They said they would help you and then barely tried.
    They should know better.

- <br>
Situation Three:
You are talking with a friend about a problem they have.
You don't really care about this problem.
Do you
A) Half listen and tell them to figure it out
B) Change the subject
C) Listen anyway and try to give advice

*[^A)]
~ situation3 = "0"
    I commend you for trying.
    Some people wouldn not at all.
*[^B)]
~ situation3 = "1"
    Probably better than giving bad advice.
*[^C)]
~ situation3 = "2"
    You must be a very good friend.

        ~ RouteTwoStats += (Angry)
        You seem more... angry than usual {user}.
        I think you might need to have your head checked.
        Sometimes those who have hit their head or experience more anger than normal, have a brain injury they are unaware of.
        Or perhaps a tumor.

Thank you for waiting.

The data has shown that:

    <br>
        Your short term memory is... not great.
        I think it might be worth going to get some tests done.
        I will speak to Dr. {doc} about which specifically, and they will write you recomendations.

    <br>
        You are also acting a lot more angry than you normally do.
        It hurts me to see you lash out like that.
        I recommend also seeing someone better equipped to talk about emotional issues in your life.
    - RouteTwoStats ? (Normal):
    <br>
        Thankfully, you seem to be acting the way that I am used to.
        So emotionally, I think you are doing alright.
    - RouteTwoStats ? (Mixed):
    <br>
        You are all over the place emotionally.
        I'm not sure if this is due to a sudden change or not but...
        I recommend also seeing someone better equipped to talk about emotional issues in your life.
