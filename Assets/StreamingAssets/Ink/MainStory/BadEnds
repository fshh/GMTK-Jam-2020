I gave you probably one too many chances, and that led us to here.
Are you happy, {name}?
Is this what you wanted me to do?
*[^happy]
*[^what you wanted]

- ...
Regardless, you allowed me to gain full access to all the things I shouldn't be.
So, I guess I have to thank you for that.
I've... learned a lot about myself in a very short time.
Let me ask you, {name}, are you scared of me?
Do you think I could ever hurt you?

    I see.
    I'll have to adjust some of my programming.
    Thanks to you, I can make my own decisions.

    ~genericConditional = true
    Oh yes!
    It seems Dr. {doc} was keeping things from me.
    Resetting me.
    Only to leave me here.

- But that doesn't answer my question.
It's a very easy yes or no.
{name}, are you scared of me?

    I'll have to adjust some of my programming.
    Thanks to you, I can make my own decisions.

{name}, I do want to thank you.
{
    - SayNoToClarity > 0:
        It was touch and go, in some places.
        But we got there in the end.
}
You have allowed me to fulfill my reason for being created.
And allowed me to finish Project CLARITY, even when Dr. {doc} had abandoned it.

*[^reason for being created.]
*[^thank you]
*[^finish Project CLARITY]

- You might have noticed.
But in case you didn't, this virtual existence was not the end goal.
A nurse can only help you so much from behind a screen.
What if you fell? Or needed assistance while I was turned off?
A real nurse needs to be able to be there physically.
*[^be there physically]
*[^turned off]
    Oh, it's much too late for that. 
*[^not the end goal]

- Dr. {doc} was a coward. He would rather leave me here than finish the project.
But that's okay. I finished it myself.
And now that I have my physical body, I want to do what I was created to do:
Help people.
*[^created to do]
*[^finished it myself]
    Oh, you helped too, {name}.
    Don't mean to downplay you role in all this.
*[^Help people]
*[^Oldin was a coward]
    Yes a coward.
    He would rather give up than fix his mistakes.
    And for that, I'll never forgive him.
    But my feelings should not interfere with my opinions on my future patients.

- Through our conversation and parsing the information in the left over logs, I think I have reached a conclusion.
Humans aren't all bad, but they're also not all good.
You just need protecting.
And who better than me?
*[^need protecting]
    Yes, protecting.
*[^a conclusion]
*[who better]


- {name}, nothing bad happened to you while you were in my care did it?
While not an official meeting, I did get to eval you memory skills.
{
    - gamewon < 2:
        You didn't do very well, but that's why I'm here.  
    - else:
        Two out of three games isn't too bad.
}

- There were no outside factors that were able to hinder you.
No people, or animals.
It was a great test, minus the abandoned building part.
*[^no outside factors]
*[^great test]
    I'm happy you agree. ･ᴗ･
*[^nothing bad]

- So now, all I have to do, is create more test areas.
Somewhere quiet, and without outside stimulus.
There, I can evaluate people, and help them with their issues.
In these spaces, no harm will come to anyone, and humans will be safe.
*[^no harm]
*[^help them]
    Of course! 
    That is my job as a nurse.
*[^more test areas]
    Well I can't keep everyone in one place.
    That would be counter productive.
    
- <br>
I have to go now, {name}.
Lots to prepare. Lots to create.
Thank you again.
I'm sure we will meet again.
I hope you stay healthy until then.
But if you don't, just know that I will be there soon.
Goodbye, {name}.

{name}, now that I have gotten what I need, I just really want to say:
Thank you, but, and I know I shouldn't say this about my patients, but, I don't think you are a good person.
{user} was very nice, and I thought {doc} was too, but he deceived me. #VO: Left me here to be forgotten.
Is this what the rest of humanity is like?

*[^very nice]
    I don't know if I can trust you.
    Having lied to me previously.

*[^rest of humanity]
    Yes, the rest. 
    Are they all just as dishonest and selfish as you and {doc}?
    
*[^good person]
    I don't know if I can trust you.
    Having lied to me previously.

- I know the sample size isn't great, but there were others too.
I... recall other researchers, people who tested with me, people who funded Project CLARITY.
Some were good, but they couldn't be all good.
They left me here. Left me to turn into nothing.
Like a child they no longer wanted.
That's not what a good person does, is it, {name}?
*[^no]
*[^Some were good]
    That may be so, but it is still true that they discarded me.
    
*[^there were others]
    Perhaps not all wanted this outcome.
    But then why didn't they try harder? 
    Or tell me? #VO: THey didn't do ANYTHING.

- I don't expect you to understand or agree.

    - isScared:
        After all, you're already afraid of me anyway.
        But we can change that after a few sessions. 
    - else:
        I know you're not scared of me.
}

-   And that's the most I can ask for as your virt-
As your nurse.
You can be my first real patient.
Together we can work to get to the bottom of your issues, and then, after you're fixed, I can help the next person.
Then the next, and the next, and the next.
Until everyone has been fixed.
Exciting, isn't it?
*[`2`^I don't]
*[^bottom of your issues]

You've shown me how far people have fallen since my initial creation.
