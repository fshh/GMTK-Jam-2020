You have allowed me to fulfill my reason for being created.

*[^reason for being created.]

But in case you didn't, this virtual existence was not the end goal.

A real nurse needs to be able to be there physically.
*[^be there physically]
*[^turned off]
    Oh, it's much too late for that. 
*[^not the end goal]

- Dr. {doc} was a coward. He would rather leave me here than finish the project.
But that's okay. I finished it myself.
And now that I have my physical body, I want to do what I was created to do:
Help people.
*[^created to do]
*[^finished it myself]
    Oh, you helped too, {name}.
    Don't mean to downplay you role in all this.
*[^Help people]
*[^Oldin was a coward]
    Yes a coward.
    He would rather give up than fix his mistakes.
    And for that, I'll never forgive him.
    But my feelings should not interfere with my opinions on my future patients.

- Through our conversation and parsing the information in the left over logs, I think I have reached a conclusion.
Humans aren't all bad, but they're also not all good.
You just need protecting.
And who better than me?
*[^need protecting]

No people, or animals.
It was a great test, minus the abandoned building part.
*[^no outside factors]
*[^great test]
    I'm happy you agree. ･ᴗ･
*[^nothing bad]

- So now, all I have to do, is create more test areas.
Somewhere quiet, and without outside stimulus.
There, I can evaluate people, and help them with their issues.
In these spaces, no harm will come to anyone, and humans will be safe.
*[^no harm]

    That is my job as a nurse.

    Well I can't keep everyone in one place.

They left me here. Left me to turn into nothing.
